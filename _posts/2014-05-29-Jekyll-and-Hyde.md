title: Jekyll and Hyde
---

For the first time in forever, I have started blogging once again (Thank you [GenTech](https://nycgenerationtech.com)). So for my first post I thought it would makes the most sense to write about the platform you might be reading this sentence on. 

##Jekyll
This website is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which is templating engine built atop of Ruby that takes simple markdown and transforms it into a website.  


Those who have worked with markdown, most likely from writing countless README files for [Github](https://github.com), will notice similarities between Jekyll's syntax and those of other markdown language. However, using ruby, Jekyll is able to provide itself with a slew of different abilities, such as the ability to create new html tags in order to seamlessly apply styles to items.  

To install Jekyll, go to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and follow their quick start instructions. 

<p class='message'>Note: You need to install ruby before installing Jekyll and instructions for doing that can be found <a href="https://ruby-lang.org">here</a></p>

##Hyde

Even though I usually like to design my own UI, in order to get up and running as fast as possible, I went with a prebuilt theme called [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Hyde is built atop of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which is designed and developed to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. In order to get started with Hyde, just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
